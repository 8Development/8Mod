# kusakiMOD
Kusaki is the Japanese word for plants or vegetation (symbolizes how I hope my knowledge of Java "grows" while doing this project.)

## Features
I have no idea at all. One thing I know for certain, it will not be a PvP focused client.

## FAQ
- *When will it be completed?*
**Probably sometime next year**
- *Can I Beta Test the client?*
**Beta builds will be uploaded here to the github repo.**
- *Will this client skid other clients?*
**No, I will try and have ALL modules to be completley my own. I will be using an API though, but that is because this is the first thing I am trying to code**
- *Why do you feel qualified for this project*
**I am not qualified for this project.**
